# Localization

If you are a translator new to localize WebExtension,
you may want to read <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Internationalization>
and the [locale-specific message reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n/Locale-Specific_Message_reference).

The `messages.json` files contains all localized strings used in the extension.

The `description.txt`, `developerComments.txt` and `privacyPolicy.txt` are not directly used in the extension, and are optional.
They are used for the add-on description on <https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/dkim-verifier/>.
